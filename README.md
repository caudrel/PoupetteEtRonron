# PROJET PoupetteEtRonron

## Description

This repository is the last project I developed in 2 weeks time for the most part, during my Wild Code School bootcamp in PHP. I had to do it in parallel to a group project, so I had to manage my time well.

This is a website for a restaurant that allow the owner (and the admin-Role users) to administrate part of its content.
The menu, the users, the FAQ, the subjects of the contact form, and the opening hours are editable.

As this project was part of my evaluation, we all have been asked to do the CRUD manually (vs via Symfony) and not use EasyAdminBundle.
Also, I used this project for my exam "Titre Professionnel : Développeur Web et Web Mobile".

I coded this desktop and mobile app with PHP 8.2, with Symfony.

It uses some cool vendors/libraries such as Twig and Grumphp.
